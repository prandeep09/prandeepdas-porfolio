            <Paragraph>
              In 2018, I joined InstaFinancials, a fintech company that provides
              financial insights on businesses. The website was a goldmine of
              data, but navigating it felt like wandering through a maze. Users
              struggled to find information, the design looked outdated, and the
              development process lacked structure. As the sole UX designer and
              UI developer, I took on the challenge of transforming the platform
              with limited resources.

          <Paragraph>
            When I analyzed stakeholder feedback and performed some heuristic
            evaluation, I found three major issues:
          </Paragraph>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Paragraph>
                <strong>Confusing Information Architecture :</strong>
                Users couldnâ€™t find the data they needed quickly.
              </Paragraph>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Paragraph>
                <strong>Outdated Look & Feel:</strong>
                The design lacked consistency, reducing trust in the brand.
              </Paragraph>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Paragraph>
                <strong>Inefficient Development Workflow:</strong> No frontend
                coding standards led to slow implementation and redundant code.
              </Paragraph>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <Paragraph>
            The result? High drop-offs, bounce rate and low engagement.

            Resource constraints can fuel creativity. I leveraged
            cross-functional collaboration to fill research gaps. Data should
            drive design decisions. User insights and analytics guided every
            change. Consistency is key. A well-structured user interface
            enhances usability and trust.

            The Impact: 75% Faster Task Completion
          </h3>
          <Paragraph>
            This project taught me that good UX is a balance of good visuals and
            better usability, itâ€™s about making usersâ€™ lives easier. By focusing
            on structure, simplicity, and efficiency, I helped turn
            InstaFinancials into a more user-friendly platform, even with
            limited resources.
